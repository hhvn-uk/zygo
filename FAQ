zygo FAQ:
Q: Why are there warning messages about undefined functions!?
A: Ignore them, it's for your own good. If it compiles, it's probably fine.
   (zygo uses the widechar functions from libncursesw. On some systems these are
    defined in /usr/include/ncurses.h. On some systems they aren't. This isn't
    an issue aslong as it can link with the widechar library.)

Q: Okay, I ignored the warning messages, but it still didn't compile. Help?
A: You need ncursesw (widechar ncurses).

Q: AHHH HELP WHY IS IT OPENING A BROWSER? WHY DOES IT SAY WEIRD STUFF? WHY
   IS [LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE WEIRD] HAPPENING?
A: It's probably xdg-open's fault. zygo is designed primarily as a browser of
   gopher menus, but can also display text files for convenience. For any other
   file, the plumber is invoked to decide what to do with the file, allowing for
   greater customizability and unified behaviour between multiple programs using
   the same concept. One recommendation I've seen is rifle(1) from the ranger(1)
   file manager. (Writing your own plumber is simple, the uri of the file is
   placed in argv[1] of the plumber).
   The idea of a plumber comes from plan9:

   If you were a cgo user, and liked cgo_plumber despite its flaws, you can
   still use it by installing it and setting it as the plumber in config.h.
